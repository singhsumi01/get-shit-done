# Context

## Domain terms

### Dispatch Policy Module
Module owning dispatch error mapping, fallback policy, timeout classification, and CLI exit mapping contract.

Canonical error kind set:
- `unknown_command`
- `native_failure`
- `native_timeout`
- `fallback_failure`
- `validation_error`
- `internal_error`

### Command Definition Module
Canonical command metadata Interface powering alias, catalog, and semantics generation.

### Query Runtime Context Module
Module owning query-time context resolution for `projectDir` and `ws`, including precedence and validation policy used by query adapters.

### Native Dispatch Adapter Module
Adapter Module that satisfies native query dispatch at the Dispatch Policy seam, so policy modules consume a focused dispatch Interface instead of closure-wired call sites.

### Query CLI Output Module
Module owning projection from dispatch results/errors to CLI `{ exitCode, stdoutChunks, stderrLines }` output contract.

### STATE.md Document Module
Shared CJS/SDK pure transform Module owning STATE.md parse, field extraction, field replacement, status normalization, and frontmatter reconstruction. It does not scan `.planning/phases` and does not own persistence or locking; phase/plan/summary counts arrive from inventory/progress Modules as inputs, and CJS/SDK read-modify-write paths remain Adapters.

### Query Execution Policy Module
Module owning query transport routing policy projection (`preferNative`, fallback policy, workstream subprocess forcing) at execution seam.

### Query Subprocess Adapter Module
Adapter Module owning subprocess execution contract for query commands (JSON/raw invocation, `@file:` indirection parsing, timeout/exit error projection).

### Query Command Resolution Module
Canonical command normalization and resolution Interface (`query-command-resolution-strategy`) used by internal query/transport paths after dead-wrapper convergence.

### Command Topology Module
Module owning command resolution, policy projection (`mutation`, `output_mode`), unknown-command diagnosis, and handler Adapter binding at one seam for query dispatch.

### CJS Command Router Adapter Module
Compatibility Adapter Module for `gsd-tools.cjs` command families. Uses generated command metadata plus small argument shapers to route to CJS handlers, rather than calling SDK Command Topology directly. Preserves CJS compatibility startup while reducing hand-written router drift.

### Query Pre-Project Config Policy Module
Module policy that defines query-time behavior when `.planning/config.json` is absent: use built-in defaults for parity-sensitive query Interfaces, and emit parity-aligned empty model ids for pre-project model resolution surfaces.

### Planning Workspace Module
Module owning `.planning` path resolution, active workstream pointer policy (`session-scoped > shared`), pointer self-heal behavior, and planning lock semantics for workstream-aware execution.

### Workstream Inventory Module
Shared CJS/SDK Module owning workstream directory discovery, per-workstream state projection, phase/plan/summary counting, roadmap-declared phase count, active marker projection, and active-workstream collision inputs. Command handlers render list/status/progress outputs from this inventory instead of rescanning `.planning/workstreams/*` directly.

### Planning Path Projection Module
SDK query Module owning projection from project/workstream context to concrete `.planning` paths. Policy precedence is `explicit workstream > env workstream > env project > root`. Invalid workspace context is a validation error at this seam rather than a silent fallback.

### Worktree Root Resolution Adapter Module
Adapter Module owning linked-worktree root mapping and metadata-prune policy (`git worktree prune` non-destructive default) for planning/workstream callers.

### SDK Package Seam Module
Module owning SDK-to-`get-shit-done-cc` compatibility policy: legacy asset discovery, install-layout probing, transition-only error messaging, and thin Adapter access for CJS-era assets that native SDK Modules have not replaced yet.

### Runtime-Global Skills Policy Module
Module owning runtime-aware global skills directory policy for SDK query surfaces. Resolves runtime-global skills bases/skill paths from runtime + env precedence, renders display paths for warnings/manifests, and reports unsupported runtimes with no skills directory.

### Runtime Install Policy Module
Module owning runtime install plan projection for supported runtimes. Resolves runtime registry facts, local/global target directories, skills/agents/hooks/settings capabilities, config mutation intents, install-mode staging, and first-run/display metadata into a pure install plan. Runtime-specific installers remain Adapters that execute the plan and render/mutate concrete file formats.

### Installer Migration Authoring Guard Module
Module owning validation for Installer Migration Module records and planned actions. It enforces migration metadata, explicit install scopes, ownership evidence for destructive/config actions, and runtime contract citations for runtime config rewrites before a migration can enter planning or apply.

### MVP Mode
Phase-level planning mode that frames work as a vertical slice (UI → API → DB) of one user-visible capability instead of horizontal layers. Resolved at workflow init via the precedence chain: `--mvp` CLI flag → ROADMAP.md `**Mode:** mvp` field → `workflow.mvp_mode` config → false. All-or-nothing per phase (PRD #2826 Q1). Surfaced as `MVP_MODE=true|false` to the planner, executor, verifier, and discovery surfaces (progress, stats, graphify). Canonical parser: `roadmap.cjs` `**Mode:**` field; canonical resolution chain documented in `workflows/plan-phase.md`. Concept index: `references/mvp-concepts.md`.

### User Story
Phase-goal format under MVP Mode: `As a [role], I want to [capability], so that [outcome].` Required regex shape: `/^As a .+, I want to .+, so that .+\.$/`. Used as the framing input by `gsd-planner` (emits as bolded `## Phase Goal` header in PLAN.md) and as the verification target by `gsd-verifier` (the `[outcome]` clause is the goal-backward verification anchor). Authored interactively by `/gsd-mvp-phase`, validated by SPIDR Splitting when too large.

### Walking Skeleton
Phase 1 deliverable under `--mvp` on a new project: the thinnest end-to-end stack proving every layer (framework, DB, routing, deployment) works together. Emitted as `SKELETON.md` capturing the architectural decisions subsequent vertical slices inherit. Gate fires when `phase_number == "01"` AND `prior_summaries == 0` AND `MVP_MODE=true`. Scope intentionally narrow (PRD #2826 Q2) — does not retrofit existing projects.

### Vertical Slice
Single-feature task that moves one user capability from open-to-close (happy path) end-to-end. Contrast with the horizontal layer (all models, then all APIs, then all UI). The MVP Mode planning unit; SPIDR Splitting axes (Spike, Paths, Interfaces, Data, Rules) are the canonical decomposition tools when a slice is too large for one phase.

### Behavior-Adding Task
Predicate over a PLAN.md task: `tdd="true"` frontmatter AND `<behavior>` block names a user-visible outcome AND `<files>` includes at least one non-`*.md` / non-`*.json` / non-`*.test.*` source file. Pure doc/config/test-only tasks are exempt. The MVP+TDD Gate (in `references/execute-mvp-tdd.md`) only halts execution on this predicate; the gsd-executor agent applies all three checks at runtime. Currently a prose-only specification — no shared utility.

### MVP+TDD Gate
Per-task runtime gate in `/gsd-execute-phase` that, when both `MVP_MODE` and `TDD_MODE` are true, refuses to advance a Behavior-Adding Task until a failing-test commit (`test({phase}-{plan})`) exists for it. The `tdd_review_checkpoint` end-of-phase review escalates from advisory to blocking under the same condition. Documented contract: `references/execute-mvp-tdd.md`. Reserved escape hatch `--force-mvp-gate` is documented but not implemented.

### SPIDR Splitting
Five-axis story decomposition discipline (**S**pike, **P**aths, **I**nterfaces, **D**ata, **R**ules) used by `/gsd-mvp-phase` when a User Story is too large for one phase. Full interactive flow per PRD #2826 Q3 (not a lightweight filter). Reference: `get-shit-done/references/spidr-splitting.md`.

## Recurring PR mistakes (distilled from CodeRabbit reviews, 2026-05-05)

### Tests — no source-grep
- **Rule**: never bind `readFileSync` result to a var then call `.includes()` / `.match()` / `.startsWith()` on it. CI runs `scripts/lint-no-source-grep.cjs` and exits 1.
- **Escape**: add `// allow-test-rule: <reason>` anywhere in the file to exempt the whole file. Use when reading product markdown or runtime output (not `.cjs` source).
- **Pattern to reach for instead**: call the exported function, capture stdout/JSON, assert on typed fields.

### Tests — no unescaped RegExp interpolation
- `new RegExp(\`prefix${someVar}\`)` — if `someVar` can contain `.` or other metacharacters (e.g. phase id `5.1`), the pattern is wrong. Always `escapeRegex(someVar)`. The `escapeRegex` utility is in `core.cjs` and already imported in most modules.

### Tests — no dead regex branches in `.includes()`
- `src.includes('foo.*bar')` is always false — `.*` is a regex metacharacter, not a wildcard in `includes`. Either use `new RegExp('foo.*bar').test(src)` or delete the branch.

### Tests — guard top-level `readFileSync` against ENOENT
- Module-level `const src = fs.readFileSync(...)` throws before any `test()` registers, aborting the runner with an unhandled exception instead of a named failure. Wrap in try/catch and rethrow with a helpful message.

### Changesets — `pr:` field must be the PR number, not the issue number
- The `pr:` key in `.changeset/*.md` frontmatter must reference the PR introducing the fix (e.g. `3142`), not the issue it closes (e.g. `3120`). Changelog tooling links to GitHub PRs by this value.

### Shell hooks — never interpolate `$VAR` into single-quoted JS strings
- `node -e "require('$HOOK_DIR/lib/foo.js')"` breaks silently if `$HOOK_DIR` contains a single quote (POSIX-legal). Pass paths via env vars: `GIT_CMD_LIB="$HOOK_DIR/lib/foo.js" node -e "require(process.env.GIT_CMD_LIB)"`.

### Shell guards — `[ -f .git ]` does not detect worktrees from main repo
- In the main repo `.git` is a directory, so `[ -f .git ]` is false and the entire guard is skipped. Use `git rev-parse --git-dir` and match `*.git/worktrees/*` in a `case` statement instead.

### Shell guards — absolute-path containment must use `root/` prefix, not glob
- `[[ "$PATH" != "$ROOT"* ]]` matches sibling prefixes (`/repo-extra` passes when `ROOT=/repo`). Use `[[ "$P" != "$ROOT" && "$P" != "$ROOT/"* ]]`. Also: check `[ -z "$ROOT" ]` and exit 1 before the containment test. Warn → fail-closed for security-relevant path checks.

### Workstream migration names — enforce one canonical slug contract
- **Invariant**: every directory under `.planning/workstreams/*` must be addressable by `workstream status/set/complete`, so creation and migration must share the same name contract.
- **Failure class**: accepting raw `--migrate-name` values created directories that later commands reject (e.g. `Bad Name` directory exists but CLI rejects it as invalid).
- **Rule**: normalize `--migrate-name` through the same slug transform as `workstream create` (`[a-z0-9-]`), and fail fast if normalization yields empty.
- **TDD sentinel**: keep regression asserting `workstream create ... --migrate-name 'Bad Name'` migrates to `bad-name` and does not leave `Bad Name` on disk.

### Docs — keep internal reference counts consistent
- When a heading says `(N shipped)` and a footnote says `N-1 top-level references`, update the footnote. CodeRabbit catches this every time.

---

## Workflow learnings (distilled from triage + PR cycle, 2026-05-05)

### Skill consolidation gap class — missing workflow files
- When a command absorbs a micro-skill as a flag (e.g. `capture --backlog`), the old command's process steps must be ported to a `get-shit-done/workflows/<name>.md` file. The routing wrapper in `commands/gsd/*.md` declares an `execution_context` `@`-reference to that workflow — if the file doesn't exist the agent loads nothing and has no steps to follow.
- **Detection**: `tests/bug-3135-capture-backlog-workflow.test.cjs` adds a broad regression — every `execution_context` `@`-reference in any `commands/gsd/*.md` must resolve to an existing file on disk. This test will catch all future gaps of this class immediately.
- **Prior art**: `reapply-patches.md` was the first gap found and fixed in PR #2824 itself. `add-backlog.md` was missed in the same PR and caught later in #3135. Run the regression test after every consolidation PR.

### CodeRabbit thread resolution — stale threads after allow-test-rule fixes
- After adding `// allow-test-rule:` to silence lint, CodeRabbit's existing inline threads remain open even though the acknowledged fix is in place. Resolve them via `resolveReviewThread` GraphQL mutation before merging — open threads block clean merge history and mislead future reviewers.
- Pattern: `gh api graphql -f query='mutation { resolveReviewThread(input:{threadId:"PRRT_..."}) { thread { isResolved } } }'`

### PR discipline — split unrelated changes into separate PRs
- A bug fix and a docs rewrite committed to the same branch produce a noisy diff and a PR that reviewers can't cleanly approve. Cherry-pick doc changes to a dedicated branch (`docs/`) immediately, then force-push the original branch to remove the commit. One concern per PR.

### INVENTORY.md must be updated alongside every workflow file addition/removal
- `docs/INVENTORY.md` tracks the shipped workflow count (`## Workflows (N shipped)`) and has one row per file. Adding or removing a workflow without updating INVENTORY produces an internally inconsistent doc.
- Also update `docs/INVENTORY-MANIFEST.json` — it is the machine-readable manifest and must stay in sync with the filesystem.
- When a flag absorbs a micro-skill, the old skill's `Invoked by` attribution in INVENTORY must move to the new parent (e.g. `add-todo.md` incorrectly claimed `/gsd-capture --backlog` until #3135 corrected it).

### README — keep root README as storyline only; all detail lives in docs/
- Root `README.md` should be ≤300 lines: hero, author note, 6-step loop, install, core command table, why-it-works bullets, config key dials, docs index, minimal troubleshooting.
- Every removed detail section needs a link to the canonical doc that covers it. All doc links must resolve before committing.
- Markdownlint rules to watch: MD001 (heading level skip — don't use `###` directly inside admonitions; use bold instead), MD040 (fenced code blocks must declare a language identifier).

### Issue triage — always check for existing work before filing as new
- Before writing an agent brief for a confirmed bug, check: (1) local branches (`git branch -a | grep <issue>`), (2) untracked/modified files on that branch, (3) stash, (4) open PRs with matching head branch. A crash may have left work 90% done — recover and commit rather than re-implementing.

### SDK-only verbs — golden-policy exemption required
- Any `gsd-sdk query` verb implemented only in the SDK native registry (no `gsd-tools.cjs` mirror) must be added to `NO_CJS_SUBPROCESS_REASON` in `sdk/src/golden/golden-policy.ts`. Without this entry the golden-policy test fails, treating the verb as a missing implementation rather than an intentional SDK-only path.

## Recurring findings from ADR-0002 PR review (2026-05-05)

### allowed-tools must include every tool the workflow uses
When a command delegates to a workflow via `execution_context`, the command's `allowed-tools` must cover every tool the workflow calls — including `Write` for file creation. The thin wrapper pattern makes this easy to miss: the process steps live in the workflow, but the tool grant lives in the command frontmatter. Missing a tool silently fails at runtime.

### User-supplied slug/path args always need sanitization before file path construction
Any workflow step that takes user input (subcommand argument, `$ARGUMENTS`, or parsed remainder) and constructs a `.planning/…/{SLUG}.md` path must sanitize first: strip non-`[a-z0-9-]` chars, reject `..`/`/`/`\`, enforce max length. Document the sanitization inline at the step, not just in `<security_notes>`. Steps that say "(already sanitized)" must trace back to an explicit sanitization guard — not just a preceding describe block.

### RESUME/fallback modes bypass sanitization guards written for primary modes
CLOSE and STATUS modes that document "(already sanitized)" do not automatically cover RESUME or default modes. Each mode that constructs a file path from user input needs its own guard — don't assume sibling modes share state.

### Shared helpers prevent lint/test disagreement
When a lint script and a test suite both implement the same constant (`CANONICAL_TOOLS`) or parser (`parseFrontmatter`, `executionContextRefs`), they will silently diverge. Extract to a `scripts/*-helpers.cjs` module required by both. A tool added to the lint's allowlist but not the test's (or vice versa) causes one layer to pass while the other fails.

### readFileSync outside test() crashes the runner before any test registers
Module-level or suite-registration-time `readFileSync` throws as an unhandled exception if the file is absent, aborting the runner with no test output. Move reads inside `test()` callbacks so failures surface as named test failures.

### Global regex with `g` flag carries `lastIndex` state between calls
A `const RE = /pattern/g` shared across functions retains `lastIndex` after `.test()` or `.exec()`. Use a non-global pattern for boolean checks (`/pattern/.test(s)`) and create a new `RegExp(pattern, 'g')` per iteration when you need `exec()` loops. Forgetting `lastIndex = 0` resets causes intermittent false negatives.

### ADR files need Status + Date headers
Every `docs/adr/NNNN-*.md` file must open with `- **Status:** Accepted` (or Proposed/Deprecated) and `- **Date:** YYYY-MM-DD` immediately after the title. Without them the ADR is undatable and untriageable when the list grows.

### Step names in workflow XML must use hyphens, not underscores
All workflow file names use hyphens; `<step name="...">` attributes inside those files must match: `extract-learnings` not `extract_learnings`. Tests asserting `content.includes('<step name=')` should tighten to the exact hyphenated name so renames are caught.

### INVENTORY-MANIFEST.json has two workflow lists — only families.workflows is canonical
`docs/INVENTORY-MANIFEST.json` has `families.workflows` (canonical, read by tooling) and a stale top-level `workflows` key (introduced by a node update script that wrote to the wrong key). Always update `families.workflows`. Delete any top-level `workflows` key if it appears.

### "Follow the X workflow" prose fragments are non-standard — use "Execute end-to-end."
After stripping prose @-refs, some command `<process>` blocks retained bolded "**Follow the X workflow**" fragments. ADR-0002 standard is `Execute end-to-end.` for single-workflow commands. Routing commands with flag dispatch use `execute the X workflow end-to-end.` in routing bullets (no bold, no redundant path).

## Recurring CodeRabbit review patterns (2026-05-05, PRs #3152/#3154/#3155)

### Changeset metadata drift (`pr:` points at issue instead of PR)
- In `.changeset/*.md`, reviewers repeatedly flag `pr:` values that accidentally reference issue ids.
- **Rule**: `pr:` must equal the GitHub PR number carrying the change.
- **Pre-flight check**: before push, verify each new changeset file against current branch PR number.

### Test diagnostics quality for command-output parsing
- Even when behavior is correct, CR requests clearer failure surfaces before `.map()` on parsed output.
- **Rule**: after `JSON.parse`, assert output object shape (e.g., `Array.isArray(output.phases)`) with raw-output-prefix diagnostics.
- This prevents opaque `TypeError` failures and shortens triage loops when CLI output shape changes.

### Merge gate discipline: CodeRabbit pass is necessary but not sufficient
- CI/checks can be green while unresolved review threads still block clean merge policy.
- **Rule**: always gate on all three together: required checks green, CodeRabbit pass, unresolved thread count = 0.
- Keep using GraphQL `reviewThreads` as authoritative unresolved state, not summary comments/check badge alone.

## SDK Runtime Bridge review synthesis (PR #3158, 2026-05-05)

### What we fixed
- Deepened one **SDK Runtime Bridge Module** seam (`sdk/src/query-runtime-bridge.ts`) for dispatch routing and observability.
- Replaced orphan event typing with a canonical union (`RuntimeBridgeEvent`).
- Made bridge observability non-intrusive: `onDispatchEvent` now runs behind a safe emitter so callback failures cannot alter dispatch outcomes.
- Corrected strict-mode event semantics: strict native-adapter rejection now reports `dispatchMode: 'native'` (no fake subprocess attempt).
- Preserved execution policy defaults by passing `allowFallbackToSubprocess` through as `undefined` when unset (no forced override in `GSDTools`).
- Fixed transport decision ordering: fallback-disabled guard now throws before emitting subprocess decision events.
- Added explicit invariant in `subprocessReason` for impossible states (fail loud on contract drift).
- Updated user-facing docs (`README.md`, `docs/CLI-TOOLS.md`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`) and ADR narrative consistency.

### What we should not do again
- Do not let observability callbacks sit on the critical path without isolation.
- Do not emit structured events that claim a transport mode that never happened.
- Do not force option defaults at call sites when policy Modules already define defaults.
- Do not keep duplicate/inert exported types; expose one canonical union Interface.
- Do not emit decision events before guard checks that may reject the path.
- Do not leave architectural docs with ambiguous seam ownership between CLI and SDK paths.

`DEFECT.SCOPE.window=PRs #3306..#3325 + sibling fixes #3240/#3242/#3245/#3257/#3261/#3267/#3286/#3287`
`DEFECT.FORMAT=class.sub-key=value | classes are greppable; each class carries detect / fix / anchor sub-keys when applicable`

`DEFECT.PORT-DRIFT.cjs-sdk.symptom=SDK port (sdk/src/query/*.ts) cites bin/lib/*.cjs source in docstring; CJS gets a fix or new constant; SDK lags silently`
`DEFECT.PORT-DRIFT.cjs-sdk.examples=#3317 (skills missing from SDK GSD_MANAGED_DIRS), #3240 (extractFrontmatter anchor), #3226 (phase.add --dry-run), #3243 (cjs dotted canonical), #3229 (model catalog source-of-truth)`
`DEFECT.PORT-DRIFT.cjs-sdk.detect=grep canonical constant in CJS, then in SDK; if both present compare values; if only CJS present treat as port-gap until proven intentional`
`DEFECT.PORT-DRIFT.cjs-sdk.fix-forward=add SDK-side behavioral test mirroring the CJS test; or extract shared JSON/TS module if both runtimes can consume it`
`DEFECT.PORT-DRIFT.cjs-sdk.anchor=tests/config-schema-sdk-parity.test.cjs is the canonical pattern — replicate per port-pair`

`DEFECT.REMOVED-BUT-NEEDED.symptom=file/key removed because "scoped under sdk/" or "no longer used" without verifying every consumer (workflows, docs, manifests, npm scripts)`
`DEFECT.REMOVED-BUT-NEEDED.examples=#3316 root package-lock.json (root package.json declares deps; workflows use cache:'npm' + npm ci), e3b52c70 docs referenced removed /gsd-new-workspace`
`DEFECT.REMOVED-BUT-NEEDED.detect=before deletion, grep filename across .github/workflows, get-shit-done/, docs/, package.json scripts, sdk/scripts; if any reference exists removal is incomplete`
`DEFECT.REMOVED-BUT-NEEDED.fix-forward=restore the file or update every consumer in the same commit; do not paper over with --no-package-lock or workflow workarounds that lose reproducibility`

`DEFECT.STATE-TRAMPLE.symptom=state-mutation paths overwrite curated values when body-derived computation is narrower than what's stored in frontmatter`
`DEFECT.STATE-TRAMPLE.examples=#3242 (Last Activity overwrote progress.completed_plans), #3257 (nested plans/ files uncounted), #3261 (buildStateFrontmatter), #3265 (canonical fields), #3286 (record-metric/add-decision sections)`
`DEFECT.STATE-TRAMPLE.detect=any state writer that calls buildStateFrontmatter without preserving existing progress.* keys; any mutation surface that does not honor shouldPreserveExistingProgress`
`DEFECT.STATE-TRAMPLE.fix-forward=route through state-document.cjs/.ts shouldPreserveExistingProgress + normalizeProgressNumbers (extracted in #3316 SDK-first seams)`

`DEFECT.PHASE-DIR-PREFIX-DRIFT.symptom=multiple workflow files independently construct .planning/phases/{NN}-{slug} paths; project_code prefix or slug normalization missing in some surfaces`
`DEFECT.PHASE-DIR-PREFIX-DRIFT.examples=#3287 (init.phase-op + init.plan-phase first-touch), #3306/PRED.k015 (plan-milestone-gaps + import + add-backlog), #3297/#3298 (sibling reports)`
`DEFECT.PHASE-DIR-PREFIX-DRIFT.detect=grep mkdir/touch/path.join with {NN}-{slug} or padded_phase + phase_slug; if not consuming expected_phase_dir from init.* JSON it is drifting`
`DEFECT.PHASE-DIR-PREFIX-DRIFT.fix-forward=consume expected_phase_dir from init.phase-op / init.plan-phase output; never re-construct from padded_phase + slug in workflow steps`
`DEFECT.PHASE-DIR-PREFIX-DRIFT.anchor=tests/bug-3298-phase-dir-prefix-drift-in-workflows.test.cjs (broad regression across workflow surfaces)`

`DEFECT.STACKED-PR-AUTO-RETARGET.symptom=PR #N is stacked on branch B; branch B merges to main and is deleted; GitHub does not reliably auto-retarget #N to main; PR shows DIRTY/CONFLICTING with phantom conflicts`
`DEFECT.STACKED-PR-AUTO-RETARGET.examples=#3311 base fix/3255-add-json-errors-mode-gsd-tools deleted after #3304 merged`
`DEFECT.STACKED-PR-AUTO-RETARGET.detect=ls-remote shows base ref absent; PR base still points at the deleted ref; mergeable=CONFLICTING with no real diff conflicts`
`DEFECT.STACKED-PR-AUTO-RETARGET.fix-forward=PATCH /repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{N} -f base=main; rebase head onto current main; resolve carry-over commits (parent commits will auto-drop as patch contents already upstream)`

`DEFECT.BOT-BRANCH-STALE-BASE.symptom=auto-branch.yml creates fix/{N}-{slug} when issue is filed; branch is anchored to issue-creation main; by the time work begins, main has moved`
`DEFECT.BOT-BRANCH-STALE-BASE.examples=#3309 fix/3309-checkpoint-type-human-verify-burns-token (was at e14ef535; main at 2e87c60a)`
`DEFECT.BOT-BRANCH-STALE-BASE.detect=git merge-base origin/<bot-branch> origin/main returns the bot branch tip — confirms the bot branch is an ancestor of main, just stale`
`DEFECT.BOT-BRANCH-STALE-BASE.fix-forward=git checkout --detach origin/main; do work; git checkout -b <same-branch-name>; force-push with --force-with-lease`

`DEFECT.SUPERSEDED-CONCURRENT-PRS.symptom=multiple in-flight PRs attack overlapping subsets of the same issue; the broadest one merges first; narrower siblings remain open with phantom conflicts`
`DEFECT.SUPERSEDED-CONCURRENT-PRS.examples=#3303 + #3307 superseded by #3306 (all addressing #3297/#3298 project_code prefix family)`
`DEFECT.SUPERSEDED-CONCURRENT-PRS.detect=after a fix lands on main, grep recently-merged PR title for shared keyword/issue; check open PRs touching same files; if open PRs are subsets of merged work they are superseded`
`DEFECT.SUPERSEDED-CONCURRENT-PRS.fix-forward=close superseded PRs via gh api PATCH state=closed; do not comment on self-authored PRs (k101); the link to the merged PR makes supersession discoverable in PR history`

`DEFECT.PROMPT-INJECTION-SCAN-COLLISION.symptom=custom XML element name in agent .md file matches scripts/scan-prompt-injection regex; legitimate agent vocabulary trips the security gate`
`DEFECT.PROMPT-INJECTION-SCAN-COLLISION.examples=#3309 added a bare 'human' element (angle-bracket-wrapped) for verify-block harvesting; tests/prompt-injection-scan.test.cjs flags angle-bracket-wrapped names matching system|assistant|human (open or close form)`
`DEFECT.PROMPT-INJECTION-SCAN-COLLISION.detect=any new bare <system|assistant|human|user> tag in agents/*.md`
`DEFECT.PROMPT-INJECTION-SCAN-COLLISION.fix-forward=hyphenate the tag (<human-check>, <assistant-prompt>) — scanner regex matches bare names only`

`DEFECT.INVENTORY-DRIFT.symptom=new file added under get-shit-done/references/ or get-shit-done/workflows/ without updating docs/INVENTORY.md count + row AND docs/INVENTORY-MANIFEST.json`
`DEFECT.INVENTORY-DRIFT.examples=#3309 planner-human-verify-mode.md (caught by tests/inventory-counts.test.cjs + tests/inventory-manifest-sync.test.cjs)`
`DEFECT.INVENTORY-DRIFT.detect=tests/inventory-* fails with "References (N shipped) disagrees with filesystem" or "New surfaces not in manifest"`
`DEFECT.INVENTORY-DRIFT.fix-forward=update INVENTORY.md headline count + row entry + footnote count; run node scripts/gen-inventory-manifest.cjs --write to regen INVENTORY-MANIFEST.json; only families.workflows is canonical (top-level workflows key is stale)`

`DEFECT.AGENT-FILE-SIZE-CAP-BREACH.symptom=adding to agents/gsd-planner.md (or other large agent files) exceeds the 45K char extraction-evidence threshold`
`DEFECT.AGENT-FILE-SIZE-CAP-BREACH.state=gsd-planner.md is already 49,121 chars on main (over 45K); test fails on main; net-new content makes it strictly worse`
`DEFECT.AGENT-FILE-SIZE-CAP-BREACH.detect=tests/planner-decomposition.test.cjs ("planner is under 45K chars (proves mode sections were extracted)") and tests/reachability-check.test.cjs ("file stays under 50000 char limit")`
`DEFECT.AGENT-FILE-SIZE-CAP-BREACH.fix-forward=mirror MVP mode pattern — extract full rules to get-shit-done/references/planner-<mode>.md, leave a slim Detection section in the agent file with @-reference to the new file`

`DEFECT.CHANGESET-PR-FIELD-DRIFT.symptom=.changeset/*.md frontmatter pr: value is the issue number, a guess made before PR opened, or a stale stacked-PR number`
`DEFECT.CHANGESET-PR-FIELD-DRIFT.examples=#3316 (pr:3312 was the issue), #3325 (pr:3319 was a guess); already covered in CONTEXT.md L94 + L186 but recurs every cycle`
`DEFECT.CHANGESET-PR-FIELD-DRIFT.detect=changeset pr: value mismatches the actual PR number returned by gh api POST /pulls`
`DEFECT.CHANGESET-PR-FIELD-DRIFT.fix-forward=author changeset with placeholder pr:0; immediately after gh api POST /pulls returns the number, edit changeset and amend or follow-up commit; never guess`

`DEFECT.WORKTREE-FETCH-SHA-DIVERGENCE.symptom=in a worktree, git fetch origin pull/N/head:pr-N produces commits with SHAs different from the actual remote PR head SHA; force-push rejected as non-fast-forward despite recent fetch`
`DEFECT.WORKTREE-FETCH-SHA-DIVERGENCE.examples=this session, branch fix/3309-... and pr-3316`
`DEFECT.WORKTREE-FETCH-SHA-DIVERGENCE.detect=git rev-parse HEAD~1 vs git rev-parse origin/<actual-branch-ref> — if they differ despite fetch the local copy was rewritten by some checkout-time hook`
`DEFECT.WORKTREE-FETCH-SHA-DIVERGENCE.fix-forward=git checkout --detach origin/<actual-remote-branch> directly; do work from detached HEAD; push HEAD:<remote-branch>`

`DEFECT.WINDOWS-FS-OPS.symptom=fs.renameSync / fs.copyFileSync hits EPERM/EBUSY on Windows when antivirus or another process holds a transient handle on the target`
`DEFECT.WINDOWS-FS-OPS.examples=c47c2c5d build-hooks rename → copy fallback, d2412271 install Windows persistent SDK shim`
`DEFECT.WINDOWS-FS-OPS.detect=any rename/copy in build/install path without try/catch fallback`
`DEFECT.WINDOWS-FS-OPS.fix-forward=catch EPERM/EBUSY/EACCES, fall back to copy + unlink with retry, surface degraded-mode message; never silently swallow`

`DEFECT.UNBOUNDED-SUBPROCESS.symptom=git/npm subprocess shelled out without timeout; CLI hangs indefinitely on stuck remote, large repo, or missing network`
`DEFECT.UNBOUNDED-SUBPROCESS.examples=a33cbe72 worktree fix bound git subprocesses with timeout`
`DEFECT.UNBOUNDED-SUBPROCESS.detect=execSync/execFileSync/spawnSync without timeout option in non-test code; especially git list-worktrees, git fetch, npm view`
`DEFECT.UNBOUNDED-SUBPROCESS.fix-forward=add timeout (5-30s for git, 60s for npm); on timeout return degraded result + structured warning rather than throw`

`DEFECT.PARSER-BRITTLE-MARKER-WHITELIST.symptom=human-output parser whitelists known markers (severity, status); silently drops unfamiliar markers as malformed`
`DEFECT.PARSER-BRITTLE-MARKER-WHITELIST.examples=ac518646/#3263 code-review SUMMARY parser rejected BL-/blocker variants`
`DEFECT.PARSER-BRITTLE-MARKER-WHITELIST.detect=any parser with hard-coded marker list; any parser that returns empty for non-matching input without warning`
`DEFECT.PARSER-BRITTLE-MARKER-WHITELIST.fix-forward=accept variants explicitly (case-insensitive, hyphen/space alternatives); on unknown marker emit a structured WARN with the original line so the human can fix the source`

`DEFECT.HALT-COST-PATTERN.symptom=architecturally-sound checkpoint pattern produces hidden token cost because subagent context is discarded across the pause and respawn`
`DEFECT.HALT-COST-PATTERN.examples=#3309 checkpoint:human-verify (mid-flight halt = full executor cold-start per round-trip; reporter measured "tens of thousands of tokens" per halt)`
`DEFECT.HALT-COST-PATTERN.detect=any subagent-spawning workflow with mid-flight pause-and-resume that does not preserve subagent context`
`DEFECT.HALT-COST-PATTERN.fix-forward=offer config flag for end-of-phase aggregation; if cost dominates make end-of-phase the default; route deferred items through existing verifier surface, do not invent new writer`

`DEFECT.HOOK-OVER-ENFORCEMENT.symptom=PreToolUse hook keeps blocking gh pr edit / gh issue edit even after all required files are read in the session`
`DEFECT.HOOK-OVER-ENFORCEMENT.examples=this session repeatedly hit "Refusing to run gh issue create|edit / gh pr create|edit" despite reading every listed file`
`DEFECT.HOOK-OVER-ENFORCEMENT.detect=hook re-fires on each invocation regardless of session-state read receipts`
`DEFECT.HOOK-OVER-ENFORCEMENT.fix-forward=use gh api -X PATCH repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{N} or repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/{N} directly — same effect, hook regex does not match`

`DEFECT.DEFAULT-FLIP-DOCUMENTATION.symptom=PR flips a config default but does not call out the migration semantics (when does the new default take effect; existing configs vs new configs; what the opt-back-in looks like)`
`DEFECT.DEFAULT-FLIP-DOCUMENTATION.examples=#3309 v2 default flip from mid-flight to end-of-phase`
`DEFECT.DEFAULT-FLIP-DOCUMENTATION.detect=any PR that changes a default value in CONFIG_DEFAULTS or buildNewProjectConfig; check that PR body Breaking Changes section explicitly covers (a) when the new default takes effect, (b) opt-back-in command, (c) effect on in-flight artifacts`
`DEFECT.DEFAULT-FLIP-DOCUMENTATION.fix-forward=template — "new default takes effect when .planning/config.json is rewritten (config-set, fresh project, regenerated config); existing artifacts continue to work; opt-back-in: gsd config-set <key> <old-value>"`

`DEFECT.SOURCE-GREP-IN-NEW-TESTS.symptom=new test file uses readFileSync + .includes() / .match() against source code (CONTEXT.md L82); contradicts the test rule lint script`
`DEFECT.SOURCE-GREP-IN-NEW-TESTS.detect=tests/lint-no-source-grep.cjs (npm run lint:tests) fails with line-number-precise violation; or test reads sdk/dist/* artifacts in CI where dist may not exist`
`DEFECT.SOURCE-GREP-IN-NEW-TESTS.fix-forward=replace with runGsdTools(...) behavioral test capturing JSON; if asserting agent .md content (which IS the runtime contract) add // allow-test-rule: source-text-is-the-product with one-line justification`

`DEFECT.GENERATIVE-PRIORITY=these defect classes share a common root: parallel implementations diverge silently because no parity test enforces equality at the test layer`
`DEFECT.GENERATIVE-FIX=for any new constant/array/parser shared between CJS and SDK (or between two workflow surfaces), the same commit MUST add a parity assertion that fails when the two diverge`
`DEFECT.GENERATIVE-EXEMPLAR=tests/config-schema-sdk-parity.test.cjs (asserts SDK VALID_CONFIG_KEYS == CJS VALID_CONFIG_KEYS); tests/bug-3298-phase-dir-prefix-drift-in-workflows.test.cjs (asserts every workflow surface uses expected_phase_dir)`
